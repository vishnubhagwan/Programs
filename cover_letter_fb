He has completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering in the year 2018 from International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad. Currently heâ€™s working in BNY Mellon as Senior Software Developer (Backend Engineer) in Global Portfolio Services which is part of Global Custody and Cash Services (GCCS) of BNY Mellon with clients like Black Rock, Morgan Stanley, etc.
He is currently working in Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project which refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity. BEPS is of major significance for developing countries due to their heavy reliance on corporate income tax, particularly from multinational enterprises. Engaging developing countries in the international tax agenda is important to ensure that they receive support to address their specific needs. 
He has strong background on Programming languages C, C++, Java and Python. He has working experience on both Windows and Linux. He worked on Spring, Angular (Typescript) and Django web frameworks, Git version control system and wrote parallel programs for graph algorithm in open MPI.
He is a hard working candidate and I feel that he would be a good fit for this role.
